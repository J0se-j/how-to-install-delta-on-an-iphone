How to do it.
The direct method is described as the simplest way to install these files, though it may be unreliable. The process involves clicking "Yes" when a pop-up appears asking to install an app, waiting for the app to install, and then addressing a potential "Untrusted Enterprise Developer" message. To resolve this, the instructions say to go to Settings -> General -> VPN & Device Management, locate the certificate or company name, tap on it, and select "Trust."
